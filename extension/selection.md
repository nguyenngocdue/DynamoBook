# Dynamo and Dynamo Sandbox

**Dynamo** and **Dynamo Sandbox** are both visual programming tools developed by Autodesk, but they have key differences in their purposes and usage. Here are the main distinctions:

### Dynamo

1. **Integration with Autodesk Revit**:
   * Dynamo is an add-in directly integrated with Autodesk Revit and other Autodesk software like Civil 3D, Advance Steel, and Robot Structural Analysis.
   * Users can create and run scripts directly within the Revit environment, automating tasks and enhancing BIM workflows.
2. **Use in Other Autodesk Products**:
   * Dynamo can be used in other Autodesk products such as Alias and FormIt, extending computational and programming capabilities in these applications.
3. **Additional Features and Integrations**:
   * Dynamo offers advanced features such as integration with Revit's API, directly supporting data management and manipulation from BIM models.
   * Users can access and download packages from the Dynamo Package Manager to extend Dynamo's functionality.

### Dynamo Sandbox

1. **Standalone Version**:
   * Dynamo Sandbox is a standalone version of Dynamo, not integrated with any Autodesk products. It does not have direct access to Revit's API or other Autodesk software.
   * It is primarily designed for development, testing, and providing feedback on new Dynamo features without needing to install or use other Autodesk software.
2. **Limited Functionality**:
   * Dynamo Sandbox has limited functionality compared to the integrated Dynamo. It is mainly used for developing and testing scripts without needing integration with models or data from other software.
3. **Does Not Require Autodesk Products to Run**:
   * As a standalone version, Dynamo Sandbox does not require the installation of any Autodesk products to operate, making it easily accessible for learning and development purposes.

***

#### Summary

* **Dynamo**: Integrated with Revit and other Autodesk products, offering full features and capabilities to automate BIM workflows.
* **Dynamo Sandbox**: A standalone version used for development and testing, with limited functionality and no integration with Autodesk products.

Choosing between Dynamo and Dynamo Sandbox depends on your needs and purposes. If you need integration and automation within Revit or other Autodesk products, Dynamo is the appropriate choice. If you need an independent development environment for testing and learning, Dynamo Sandbox will meet your needs effectively.
