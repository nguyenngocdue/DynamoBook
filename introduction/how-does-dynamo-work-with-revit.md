# How Does Dynamo Work with Revit?

* **Integration with Revit**:
  * Dynamo operates as an add-in within Revit, enabling direct access to Revit’s API (Application Programming Interface).
  * Users can manipulate Revit elements and extract information directly from the Revit model.
* **Visual Programming Interface**:
  * The Dynamo interface consists of a workspace where users can drag and drop nodes, which represent various actions or data points.
  * Nodes are connected by wires to define the flow of data and operations, creating a visual script or graph.
* **Nodes and Connections**:
  * **Nodes**: Each node performs a specific function, such as creating geometry, querying model information, or performing mathematical operations.
  * **Wires**: These connect nodes and represent the data flow between them. The output of one node can be the input to another, enabling complex data processing and manipulation.
* **Automation and Customization**:
  * Dynamo allows users to automate repetitive tasks, such as generating multiple building elements, adjusting parameters, or performing batch modifications.
  * Custom scripts can be created to suit specific project needs, enhancing productivity and precision.
* **Interoperability**:
  * Dynamo can interact with other software and data sources, facilitating interoperability between Revit and other applications, such as Excel, Rhino, or databases.
* **Extensibility**:
  * Users can extend Dynamo’s capabilities by creating custom nodes using Python or C#, allowing for even more advanced functionality and integration.
