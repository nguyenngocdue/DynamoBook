# Dynamo Core and Dynamo Sandbox?

**Dynamo Core** and **Dynamo Sandbox** are related but not identical. Here’s a detailed comparison to clarify their differences and relationships:

#### Dynamo Core

1. **Definition**:
   * Dynamo Core refers to the core technology and libraries that underpin all Dynamo applications. It provides the fundamental computational and visual programming capabilities that can be extended and integrated into various Autodesk software.
2. **Functionality**:
   * It includes the core engine and essential features needed to run Dynamo scripts. This core functionality is used by different versions of Dynamo, such as Dynamo for Revit, Dynamo for Civil 3D, and more.
3. **Integration**:
   * Dynamo Core is integrated into several Autodesk applications, allowing these applications to leverage the computational power and automation features of Dynamo.

#### Dynamo Sandbox

1. **Definition**:
   * Dynamo Sandbox is a standalone application that uses Dynamo Core. It is essentially a stripped-down version of Dynamo, which does not integrate with any Autodesk products.
2. **Functionality**:
   * Sandbox provides a development and testing environment for Dynamo scripts, using the same core technology as other versions but without the product-specific integrations.
   * It allows users to experiment with new features and create scripts in a controlled environment.
3. **Purpose**:
   * Dynamo Sandbox is primarily used for testing, development, and educational purposes. It helps users to explore Dynamo’s capabilities without needing to install and use other Autodesk products.

#### Relationship Between Dynamo Core and Dynamo Sandbox

* **Common Core**: Both Dynamo Core and Dynamo Sandbox share the same underlying technology and computational engine.
* **Different Applications**: Dynamo Core serves as the foundation for various Autodesk integrations, while Dynamo Sandbox uses this core independently for development and testing.

#### Summary

* **Dynamo Core**: The core technology and engine that powers all Dynamo applications, integrated into various Autodesk products.
* **Dynamo Sandbox**: A standalone version of Dynamo that uses Dynamo Core for testing and development, without integration into Autodesk products.
